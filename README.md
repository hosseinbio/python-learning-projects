# Python Learning & Bioinformatics Projects

A curated collection of Python projects I’ve built while strengthening my programming skills and transitioning toward **data analysis**, **automation tools**, and **introductory bioinformatics scripting**.

This repository represents my hands-on learning path—starting from fundamentals and growing step-by-step toward real-world, domain-relevant applications.

## 1) Beginner Projects

Projects focused on fundamental Python concepts—perfect for practicing logic, functions, loops, and user interaction.

**Examples:**

* `number_guessing_game`
* `rock_paper_scissors`
* `shopping_list_manager`

**Goal:**
Build confidence with core programming and writing readable code.

---

## 2) Utility Tools

Practical, reusable scripts designed to build real-world problem-solving skills.
These emphasize cleaner structure, modularity, and simple automation.

**Examples:**

* `password_generator`
* `password_generator_streamlit`
* `contact_book`

**Goal:**
Move toward tool-building and thinking like a developer.

---

## 3) Bioinformatics Projects

Early bioinformatics tools for sequence processing and pattern analysis.
These projects gradually introduce real techniques used in molecular biology labs.

**Examples:**

* `motif_finder`
* `sequence_analysis_tool`

**Goal:**
Bridge Python with genetics—building a foundation for future bioinformatics work.

---

## Tech Stack

**Languages:**

* Python 3.10+

**Libraries Used (across projects):**

* `pandas`
* `re`
* `streamlit`
* Standard Python libraries (`os`, `pathlib`, etc.)
* ... and so on

**Tools:**

* Git & GitHub
* VSCode
* Virtual environments
* Modular Python structures

## Running a Project

Most scripts can be executed using:

```bash
python main.py
```

If additional dependencies are needed, they will be listed inside the project’s own README and requirements.

## Roadmap (Next Steps)

Here’s what I’m actively working on improving:

### Short-term

* Clean up older projects & modernize structure
* Add docstrings + function explanations
* Implement more CLI-based tools

### Medium-term

* Add beginner → intermediate data analysis projects
* Visualization projects (matplotlib, seaborn)
* Machine learning mini-projects (scikit-learn)

### Long-term

* Build more bioinformatics tools:

  * ORF scanners
  * motif & repeat analysis
  * basic aligners
* Move toward real datasets (FASTA, FASTQ, VCF)
* Deploy small web tools (Streamlit)
