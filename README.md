# Python Learning & Project Portfolio

Welcome to my Python learning and project portfolio.  
This repository documents my continuous progress in Python, data analysis, bioinformatics programming, and practical software development.  
All projects are structured, organized, and regularly updated as I advance toward professional-level competency.

## About Me

I’m a Human Genetics MSc student with a strong interest in **Python**, **data analysis**, **bioinformatics**, and **machine learning**.  
My long-term goal is to work at the intersection of biology and computation, and I’m actively building a practical, job-ready skillset through hands-on projects.

I enjoy solving real problems, learning through structured projects, and writing clean, organized code.  
This repository serves as both my learning archive and professional project portfolio.
