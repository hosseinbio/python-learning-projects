# Practice & Learning Archive

This directory contains my structured practice exercises and learning notes.
Each section reflects a specific skill area and demonstrates my progression in core Python, problem-solving, and foundational bioinformatics scripting.

The goal of this archive is to document **deliberate, consistent skill development** rather than large end-to-end projects (which are located in the `projects/` directory).
